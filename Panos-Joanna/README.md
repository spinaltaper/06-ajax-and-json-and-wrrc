# Project Name

**Author**: Panos Kumasaka and Joanna Coll
**Version**: 1.1.0 

## Overview
We are building the blog with an option to load data from JSON or local storage and populate the saved data onto the page. If the user data storage is empty we load the data from JSON. If we cannot find data in any storage the user gets the error message.

## Getting Started
1. Review the function that were already there.
2. Create function to retrieve data from either local storage or JSON.
3. Call the functions in html and articleView.js


## Architecture
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, Local Storage
